# PROBoter software

This folder contains microservices forming the PROBoter software landscape.
Each microservice is located in a separate subfolder.

## Quickstart
If you just want to use the PROBoter software, the fastest way is to use the
contained [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) setup. Just run
the following two commands in your terminal and you should be ready to go:

```
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up
```

This repository and Docker Compose setup will be extended in the near future.
