# PROBoter - A platform for automated embedded system security analysis

![PROBoter title image](/docs/title.png)

The PROBoter is a hardware and software platform to automate embedded system security analysis. The initial prototype was developed during the master's thesis **Automatisierung der hardwarenahen Sicherheitsanalyse von eingebetteten Systemen** in cooperation with [SCHUTZWERK GmbH](https://www.schutzwerk.com) and
[Hochschule Kempten](https://www.hs-kempten.de) in the context of the [SecForCARs](https://www.secforcars.de) project.

The project consists of various components which can be found in individual subfolders of this repository:

- [publications](/publications) Contains publications related to the PROBoter. You can also find citation information here if you want to reference our work in other research publications.

Other components will be released soon. Follow the [SCHUTZWERK PROBoter blog post series](https://schutzwerk.com/en/43/posts/proboter_01/) to get updates of the current development status and new component releases. So stay tuned... :)
